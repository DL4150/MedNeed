<p>Proposed Solution


We have created an app to help when there is such a shortage of staff.

In this app, the doctors and nurses can log in and enter their details i.e
Ph no, name, specialisation and role(can be seen in the healthworker-side branch).

These details are posted to a website (can be seen in the hospital-side branch), where hospitals can search for a doctor/Nurse during emergencies. 
The hospitals contact the doctors/nurses personally by email or phone.
We have used flutter for app and web development, and firebase as our Database.

Why the problem statement?

India is a country with the highest population. The healthcare system for such a population needs to be at its best. Healthcare is essential to society; there is nothing without good health and institutions to foster it. The health and welfare sector cannot keep up with the growing population and demand, leading to a high populace-filled hospital with short-staffed workers and helpers. On the other side of the spectrum is the hospitals kitted to a high populace with employees and helpers but not enough patients to satisfy it; this imbalance causes many problems and chaos.
Hence this problem needs to be solved as soon as possible</p>
