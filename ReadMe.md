<p>Proposed Solution


We have created an app to help when there is such a shortage of staff.

In this app, the doctors and nurses can log in and enter their details i.e
Ph no, name, specialisation and role(can be seen in the healthworker-side branch).

These details are posted to a website (can be seen in the hospital-side branch), where hospitals can search for a doctor/Nurse during emergencies. 
The hospitals contact the doctors/nurses personally by email or phone.
We have used flutter for app and web development, and firebase as our Database.
